For help using sed, you may find the tutorial http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html useful.

a)	Write a one-line sed command that will replace all multiple spaces in a file called names.txt 
(this is an arbitrary file that you may create yourself) by only one space.

Solution:  sed 's/[[:space:]]\+/ /g'names.txt                

b)	Consider the following file called system.txt:
1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  He 11 Hg
Ts H  15 Be
17 Mc Li 20

Write a one-line sed command that replaces the second number in every line with the string “system”, 
without the quotes. For example, after running the appropriate sed command, the following would be output to the terminal:

1 system  3  4
5  system  7  8
9  He system Hg
Ts H  15 Be
17 Mc Li system

Solution:
 sed 's/[0-9][0-9]*/system/2' system.txt        

c)	Consider the following file called swap.txt:
349 230 481
800 456 129
043 942 584 
901 627 874

Each three-digit number is separated by a space. Write a one-line sed command that performs 
in-place substitution to swap the first digit with the third digit of the first number in every line. 
For example, after running the appropriate sed command, the swap.txt file would not contain:

943 230 481
008 456 129
340 942 584 
109 627 874

Solution:
sed 's/^\([0-9]\)\([0-9]\)\([0-9]\)/\3\2\1/' swap.txt

For bonus, can you swap the first digit with the third digit of the second number in every line? 
Do not worry about performing in-place substitution for this part. For example, after running the appropriate sed command, 
the following would be output to the terminal:

349 032 481
800 654 129
043 249 584 
901 726 874

Solution: sed 's/\([0-9]\)\([0-9]\)\([0-9]\)/\3\2\1/2' swap.txt
